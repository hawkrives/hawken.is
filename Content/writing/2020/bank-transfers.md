# On Bank Transfers… 

Make sure that youve got the correct accounts picked as the "from" and "to" account.

I accidentally transferred money _out_ of one today, when I meant to put money _in_. And ACH transfers can't be cancelled (easily, at least…) sooooo

Anyway it should all work out, but it's a sobering reminder to actually check the things labeled "from" and "to".

Simple did everything they could. **I** was the problem. PEBCAK and all that.
