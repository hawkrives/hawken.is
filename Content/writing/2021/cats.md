# On Cats

> and why they manage to tangle themselves into knots while being fed

Let us reference the following meme:

./images/cats-feeding-time.jpeg

First, we have an image of three full food bowls.

Then, we have an image of a gordion knot of cats[^1] eating from those bowls.

In my experience, cat feeding time works something like this:

1. You pour food into one bowl
1. All of the cats start eating from that bowl
1. You pour food into the second bowl
1. At least one cat abandons the first bowl to attack the second, but they take the most direct path rather than backing up and making a straight shot
1. You pour food into the third bowl
1. The cat pathfinding algorithm breaks further
1. You wind up with the gordion knot of cats

fin.
