I kinda want to be on an airport construction committee now.

I'd name each terminal after a city, so instead of "Terminal A" and "Terminal B", you'd have "Terminal Albuquerque" and "Terminal Boston"â€¦ 

so you would get things like "Welcome to Denver [terminal]! Your connecting flight leaves from Boston, and you'll need to go through Calvary on your way. Have a great day!"
